# Encrypted Bind Shell

A simple encrypted bind shell using AES encryption.

## Overview

This project provides a basic implementation of a bind shell with encryption using the AES algorithm. The bind shell allows for secure communication between the server and client.

## Features

- AES encryption for secure communication
- Simple command execution between the server and client
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Usage

### Server (Listener)

To start the server (listener):

```bash
python your_script_name.py -l
```

### Client

To connect to the server:

```bash
python your_script_name.py -c <server_ip_address> -k <encryption_key>
```

- Replace `<server_ip_address>` with the IP address of the server.
- Replace `<encryption_key>` with the shared encryption key.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Crypto library (install using `pip install pycryptodome`)
